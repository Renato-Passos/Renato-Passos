## Howdy visitor, welcome! :wave:

My name is Renato, but you can call me Tato, I'm a senior Systems Analyst and Developer student at [FATEC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fatecsjc/?originalSubdomain=br).

I started studying law, however, I decided to change that a few years ago, that's when this road began.

Now I'm getting the hang of developing amidst all available technologies, the one that most got to me, by now, was pyhton.
